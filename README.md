# Research Scrapylot
Research Scrapylot is a powerful web scraping and automation project that combines the capabilities of Puppeteer, Deno, and an AI-powered selector generator. It provides a flexible and efficient solution for scraping websites, performing actions on web pages, and generating intelligent selectors using AI algorithms.

# Stack and Technologies

## Puppeteer: Utilize Puppeteer, a Node.js library, to control headless Chrome/Chromium browsers, perform web automation, and extract data from websites.
## Deno: Harness the secure runtime of Deno, a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime, for executing server-side and browser-side JavaScript/TypeScript, integrating with Python, and managing dependencies.
## Python: Leverage the powerful Python programming language to implement AI algorithms and integrate with the Deno runtime through the Python bridge.
## AI-Powered Selector Generator: Incorporate an AI-powered selector generator algorithm to dynamically generate robust and accurate web element selectors based on the structure and content of web pages.
## Development Stack
- Visual Studio Code: Use VS Code or VS Code-based IDEs like StackBlitz, CodeSandbox, or the desktop version of VS Code as the primary development environment.
- TypeScript: Develop the project using TypeScript, benefitting from the static type checking and modern JavaScript features it provides.
- Linting and Formatting: Utilize ESLint and Prettier to enforce code quality, maintain consistent code formatting, and catch potential issues in real-time.
- Testing with Jest: Employ Jest as the testing framework to write unit tests and ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
